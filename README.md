# CS3500
Homework for Univ. of Utah CS3500 Fall 2014 

PS1-6 were sequential assignments that built the backing algorithms for a single user spreadsheet. At the end, spreadsheet should be able to do basic functions, such as save existing spreadsheet to an XML file, retreive and rebuild spreadsheet from an XML file, as well as perform basic computations on any given cell within the spreadsheet. Cells were allowed to reference other cells, and there had to be error checking for circular dependencies. Backing data structure of the spreadsheet is a dependency graph.

PS7-10 were sequential assignments that built a 2 player Boggle Game, that was able to be run on two separate machines, via TCP/IP protocol and socket requests. Game mechanics, such as scoring, follow standard Boggle rules, and the GUI was designed and built by our team.
