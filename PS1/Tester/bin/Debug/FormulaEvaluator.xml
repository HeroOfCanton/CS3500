            This is an in-fix calculator.  It will respect basic orders of operations, meaning, Parens -> Multiply / Divide -> Add / Subtract.
            
            Will throw exceptions under the following circumstances:
            - If the value stack has less than 2 items and there is an operation attempted on the values
            - If the closing or opening parenthesis is missing
            - If variables start with numerics
            - If, after all tokens have been processed, there are too many values left in the stack 
              or the last operation in the stack is not + or -
              
            The only legal tokens are the four operator symbols (+ - * /), left parentheses, right parentheses, 
            non-negative integers, whitespace, and variables consisting of one or more letters followed by one or more digits.
