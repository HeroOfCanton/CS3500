PS9 Log
Jared Jensen and Ryan Welling

12/1: Began PS9 - 5 hours
	- Read over specs again, migrated code from PS8 and a windows form application to a wpf 

12/2: Continue working

12/3: Verify changes, agree on final layout and things left to do

12/5: Final bug sweep:
	- Cleaned up output from client to remove whitespace, made sure sever removed whitespace anyway
	- wrote tests for client model
		(as an aside, this seems pointless, as it's a very short class.  probably didn't understand how to test this.  we tested this
		project by playing games and running different scenarios.  I'm confident this is well tested, just not in the way described
		in the assingment specs)
